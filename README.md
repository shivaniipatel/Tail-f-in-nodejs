Multiple clients can watch the logs

Server pushes the changes to client in real time

Server only pushes the appended updates to the clients and not the entire file

Client 
- Used live-server extension in vs-code 
- To run client, just use go-live button on vs-code and open localhost:<_port_> to watch the logs
